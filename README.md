<h1> SAW Project</h1>

<h2> Intro</h2>

This project has been made by Leonardo Necordi and Federico Cerra for the final project of the University Course "Web Applications Development" (Sviluppo Applicazioni Web -> SAW).</br>

The project consisted mainly in creating a website for a **fictional** start up, with some must have features and some of choice</br>

<h2> About the Game</h2>
We insipired our website on a game that Leonardo made with other people for the GMTK GameJam 2024: <b>Chuck The Beaver</b> </br>
Here you can find the links to the game:</br>
